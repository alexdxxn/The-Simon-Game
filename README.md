# The Simon Game
This is a solution to the The Simon Game Challenge made by Angela Yu (https://twitter.com/yu_angela?lang=es) 

# The Challenge
I had to use JavaScript to make the game work, declaring variables, generating random numbers and associating them with the colour buttons. Also added animations and sounds to the sequence and the buttons pressed by the user, and then comparing the results.

## My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript ES6
- JQuery

### Continued development

- Improve the speed of understanding programming logic
- Reduce the amount of code lines with good programming practices
